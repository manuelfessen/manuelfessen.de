Welche Auswirkungen wird wird \n\nHave you ever heard of Bionic Reading before?\n\nAbout a week ago there was this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/usgac8/bionic_reading_using_font_weights_to_increase/) in r/interestingasfuck and from there it went through the internet. The sample text used by Bionic Reading GmbH to advertise its technology could be seen everywhere on social media.\n\nIt is a similar effect to **typoglycaemia**. It is the ability to read a paragraph like the following despite the jumbled words.\n\n> Aoccdrnig to a research at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.\n\nYour could read it, couldnt you? Despite the typo (rscheearch cannot spell the word \"researcher\"), it can be read and understood by almost anyone fluent in English.\n\nOff topic for a moment: Is typoglycaemia real? I can recommend [this article](https://www.dictionary.com/e/typoglycemia/), which explains this in detail. For here and now, it is only important to know that it only works with short words and that function words like \"be\" must not be affected. And most importantly: the passage is readable because it's predictable (especially because we've seen it so many times).\n\nAt first glance Bionic reading looks similar. However, it can be a real advantage if you want to read a text-heavy website quickly and find the information you need. It help some people.\n\n## Could the concept of Bionic Reading make its way into ux design?\n\nHonestly I dont know if this trend really works. I couldn’t find any research about that topic. It reeminds me on the speed reading ads years ago for online speed reading apps and courses. The starting point was to underline the first syllables of a word, which is the \"support wheel\". At some point you can read like that without text decoration.\nWhat bothers me: the \"as before\" texts are covered with all the tricks - a bit greyer and a typeface with lousy kerning and everything sans serif. This is no fair play.\nAdditionally: Some may question the elegance of regular bolding of syllables, and in short sentences it might not make any sense. There are also concerns about how it fits with the traditional use of bold, for example to highlight parts of a sentence.\n\nI look forward to the research and it may make sense, maybe only as a gimmick with an on-off switch. I will give it a Benefit of a doubt.\n"},{"slug":"hello-world","category":"blog","title":"Hello World and welcome to my blog.","description":"I rethink and implement my website with astro 🚀. With some trial and error I manage to create the MVP within a short time. It was really a lot of fun.","body":"\n<img src=\"/assets/img/blog/full-logo-light.webp\" alt=\"Astro Logo\"/>\n\n# Hello World\n\nI recently decided it was time to invest in my personal portfolio. There is no particular reason, mostly because I wanted to code a bit and this was the perfect motivation. And after some late night sessions, I had something I can be proud of. Something to show the world myself, apart from the social networks like Instagram, Twitter or LinkedIn. A platform where I do have the control and can add unnecessary features. Additionally, I had the motivation to code again, and it's a great way to start.\n\nBefore I had some attempt where I only used HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. In the process, I focused mostly on design, and then desperately realized that creating Responsive Design using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS was more difficult than I had estimated as a cocky beginner. But I dealt with it. I was somewhere very proud of my work, showed it to some developer friends and colleagues, who attested me a relatively acceptable code even for a UX designer, especially since I had apparently never done that before. They probably felt the same excitement as when I am presented with self-made front ends 😉. One colleague proposed me a static site generator named Jekyll, which would suit my needs better than writing everything myself.\n\nSo I never released the old work. Fortunately, because I had built-in some security problems, so that my Spotify account could have been controlled from the outside. Anyway. Then I found Astro 🚀.\n\n# Rebuilding the website with Astro\n\nIf you have never heard of Astro before, it's essentially a static site generator made to build web apps with less JavaScript. It is an open-source project released under the MIT license and build by the team behind [The Astro Technology Company](https://astro.build/company/). It can render JavaScript interactive components from a few different frameworks into pre-built HTML pages (it does this with a fantastic tool called Vite, pronounced veet) without any extra JavaScript. So far, so good. For me the most important part was the easy setup, the easy integration of any framework (if I ever want to do that in future) and the easy way to style the UI with tailwind. It's that package where you don't mess up anything at the beginning.\nYou can use React, Angular, Svelte, or Vue or together at any point in the project to build a super-fast and SEO-friendly website. Wow! 🥳\n\n- Stying with CSS modules, Sass and Tailwind,\n- TypeScript\n- Markdown\n- RSS feeds\n- Pagination\n- and even more\n\nIt comes with everything needed to build a website without adding or configuring libraries that support the above, a great starter into the world of JAM Stack. The perfect bundle for my needs. I made more progress on a rainy saturday and a half sunday than in all the months with different YouTube, Udemy and Blog Tutorials before. And maybe it's the right for you too, feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Or take a look in the [helpful documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) or join their great [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/grF4GTXXYm). Otherwise, I am sure you will find lots of incredible tutorials at other tech blogs, YouTube or GitHub, you can find the source code of this website there too.\n\n# Learnings\n\n"},{"slug":"remote-ux-test","category":"blog","title":"Moderated Remote Test vs Automated Remote Test","description":"It depends on the resources and goal you want to achieve with the test which one to chose.","body":"\n<img src=\"/assets/img/blog/ux-research.webp\" alt=\"UX Research Comic\"/>\n\n# Moderated Remote Test\n\nThe **moderated remote test** is defined as the test subject and the test leader are connected to each other in real time during the test, so that this variant of remote testing is most similar to the classic usability test in the laboratory. The goal of the moderated remote test is an exchange of impressions and expectations between the proband and the test supervisor. The conversation between the two participants is based on a test script designed in advance by the test supervisor. The data obtained from a moderated remote test have a qualitative character and are very similar to that of a classic laboratory test.\n\n### Pro\n\n- The supervisor can help get a deeper understanding of why the user was performing a specific task.\n- The supervisor can help clarify any confusion which will help you understand their cognitive process.\n- The supervisor can help the user in certain situations to get him to move forward.\n- the costs are low, because the supervisor and the user can use tools, they allready use in their common work live, f.e. teams.\n\n### Contra\n\n- The Supervisor can tell (to much) the participants what to do which gives bias results.\n- Interrupts the natural progression that participants could make on their own\n- The session length is very high\n\n# Automated Remote Test\n\nThe contrast to the moderated remote test is the **automated remote test**. Here the proband and supervisor are separated from each other in terms of spatial distance and time. The proband is thus independent of the supervisor and therefore on his own when processing the test case. Automated remote tests focus on quantitative data, so that a larger sample has to be interviewed than in a moderated remote test.\n\n### Pro\n\n- The proband is often in their environment which allows them to interact with the product more naturally.\n- Tasks can be completed in the users own time without the supervisor worrying about the schedule.\n- its more time effectiv for the supervisor\n\n### Contra\n\n- The absence of a supervisor implies less control, less personal observation, and an increased risk of confusion.\n- It provides limited or no qualitative feedback because users won’t often think out loud without a supervisor\n- It’s difficult to make sure users take your test seriously.\n- It doesn’t operate well with complex tasks and prototypes.\n- Several users will have technical issues and give up.\n\n# Unmoderated Remote Test\n\nThe **unmoderated/self-moderated remote test** forms a combination of the two approaches just presented. Here, too, the participant and supervisor are separated in time from each other by the spatial distance. The supervisor is replaced by an interactive system and videos which provides the respondents with usecases and questions.\n\n### Pro\n\n- Sessions are shorter than moderated usability testing → significant more time effective\n- There’s less chance of human error or bias and so results are generally more accurate\n- Supervisor doenst have to record the introduction video\n- Probands with less bandwith can absolve the test too\n\n### Contra\n\n- The absence of a supervisor implies less control, less personal observation, and an increased risk of confusion.\n- It provides limited or no qualitative feedback because users won’t often think out loud without a moderator\n- It’s difficult to make sure users take your test seriously.\n- It doesn’t operate well with complex tasks and prototypes\n- Several users will have technical issues and give up.\n\n# Summary\n\n<div class=\"px-4 py-3 leading-normal text-primary border border-current rounded-lg\" role=\"alert\">\n  <p>so, the listing is quite nice and informative, but what kind should i choose and when❓</p>\n</div>\n\nIt depends on the resources and goal you want to achieve with the test.\n\nIf you want to obtain **fast quantitative data**, the automated remote test is the one you want to choose. The test answers the question: \"What are users doing on my site?\".\n\nIf you want to obtain **qualitative data**, you should choose the (un-)moderated remote test. This test answers the question: \"Why do users act like this on my site?\"\n\n## and how do I run such a test now? \n\nCome up to me and we'll discuss which remote UX test, or even a face2face ux test, is the best for you.\n"},{"slug":"ux-research-matter","category":"blog","title":"What Is UX Research?","description":"User testing with real users is the most fundamental usability method and is in some sense irreplaceable, since it provides direct information about how people use computers and what their exact problems are with the concrete interface being tested.","body":"\n<img src=\"/assets/img/blog/ux-research.webp\" alt=\"UX Research Comic\"/>\n\n> User testing with real users is the most fundamental usability method and is in some sense irreplaceable, since it provides direct information about how people use computers and what their exact problems are with the concrete interface being tested\n> Jakob Nielsen, 1994.\n\nUX or design research is a collection of surveys, methods, and techniques meant to elicit feedback from users on separate elements of the UX or the design as a whole. It’s meant to be a subtle process of sourcing information that helps designers like us change their projects and tweak them to the user’s liking. It can include deploying a nearly finished product to a customer, a prototype, or a barebones build that’s specifically intended for testing out a single element.\n\nBy conducting all this testing and surveying, we try to get a look at my design from the perspective of my users. It’s not about making them love our ideas, it’s about tailoring our ideas so that they can be loved by the user. The onus is on the designer to do right by the user and, by analyzing the data from the design research, create excellent UX. It’s a way to improve our work and help us make sense of a project in a field that’s new to us.\n\nThe usability of a product is determined in user tests or usability tests. The most basic type of usability testing is testing with the most representative users possible, the test persons. This is to some extent essential as it provides unbiased information on how users use the product and where they experience problems using it. Usability testing can be divided into two types: depending on the objective and time of the evaluation, either a formative or a summative evaluation is used.\n\nThe goal of a formative evaluation is to identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. Therefore, they should be carried out as early as possible in the development of the product. The study focuses on qualitative statements, e.g. verbal statements, descriptions of observations or direct suggestions for improvement made by the test person. The data collected in this way is used by a test manager to identify concrete problems when using the product. Based on the results, solutions for identified problems are developed. The methods used include the Walkthrough method, the Concurrent Thinking Aloud and the Retrospective Thinking Aloud.\n\nA summative evaluation is used to evaluate a completed and finished product, i.e. a quality control or an overall assessment of the product. A summative evaluation collects quantitative data. For example, the time required or the number of errors made by the test person during the processing of the tasks are recorded and evaluated. On the basis of the knowledge gained from the summative evaluation, the quality of a product can be assessed after the test or compared and checked with the previous version, an alternative version or even a competing product. These methods can be supported by questionnaires, metrics and surveys.\n\nThe data can be optained by qualitative or quantitative methods. The former is about answering questions of responsiveness and user satisfaction. Pretty much a way to find out “why didn’t anybody click my button?” or “which elements stand out thanks to my design?”. It can be a bit harder to solidify into data since many users, when prompted, hesitate and can’t give a precise response because an end-user doesn’t think about a site in terms of elements.\n\nQuantitative design research is about gathering data on the amount of visitors pages get, the number of clicks given to a button etc. This one is easier to interpret and turn into usable data, which means you get results faster. However, I find that you have to do both if you want some real results and just surface-level improvements.\n\n# What Does a UX Researcher Do?\n\nIt’s their responsibility to conduct testing, collect feedback, and turn it all into usable data for the improvement of the UX. As a UX researcher, a person has to interact with the end-users and elicit solid responses from them, something that can actually push the design in a direction that will be received favorably.\n\n# Why Does UX Research Matter?\n\nIt’d be insane of us (or any designer, for that matter) to suggest that we have some kind of innate knowledge of what any user wants. Tastes change, preferences shift, and userbases can be drastically different depending on the project you’re working on. Having UX research on your side means coming into any task with a bit of confidence and some understanding of what needs to be done. Sure, you can always take care of the basics without it if you’re a good designer but this kind of thoroughness is what really takes the UX to the next level.\n\nSources:\n\n[Usability Engineering](https://books.google.de/books?id=95As2OF67f0C&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false)\" by Jakob Nielsen\n\n[https://uxdesign.cc/introduction-to-ux-design-research-bb9617838e79](https://uxdesign.cc/introduction-to-ux-design-research-bb9617838e79)\n\n[](https://intranet.easy.de/display/UE/UX+Research)\n"}]
