Recently I had a nice conversation with a recruiter. As I've sat on both sides of the table, he asked with questions I ask (and was asked) in the interviews and which are my favorites. Maybe you have the same question, because you are preparing for an interview for a designer role or you are interviewing one. 

Even if you donâ€™t prepare for an interview, you should be able to answer these questions.
