    "I wanted to develop an all-in-one solution, a mistake. Wanted to create everything by myself. Didn't want to use libraries. To make a long story short: I made every single mistake of a software development, even though I know better myself and use it every day due to my professional experience.",
    "To motivate myself to sit in front of my device after 8-9 hours of working is hard sometimes. it has turned out for me that I can work on it better at the weekend or on holidays.",
    "If there is no motivation, don't force yourself to continue the work. This caused me to losing motivation. This led to larger pauses between progress, which eventually led to slower progress, which affected motivation...",
    "Every progress is good progress.",

    "Take the time to ask yourself about your own work: what would I do differently today and why?",
    "Do a design challenge. This little competition compared with the opportunity to think outside of your design system unlocks lots of creativity.",

    "Design follows function, no one needs more useless Dribbble or Behance eye pleaser.",
