A UX designer's work has a positive impact on a company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in several ways. 
For example, a UX designer:

- Improves the user experience of a company's products or services, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, and ultimately higher revenue.
- Reduces the number of customer support inquiries and complaints, lowering the costs associated with handling these interactions.
- Streamlines the design of a company's products or services, making them easier and faster to use, and increasing efficiency and productivity.
- Identifies and fixes usability issues that cause customers to abandon the company's products or services, reducing lost revenue.
- and even more... 

Overall we increase revenue, reduce costs, and improve efficiency in development.
