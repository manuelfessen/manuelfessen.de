## Development/PMPO
- Estimation of when and if end of life for product is reached.
- Which 3rd party components are used and how much? Which component do users choose in case of function overlap?
- Customer's system environment (OS, patch, CPU, memory, network connection, installed software, etc.)
-  Frequency of use
## UX
- UX research (a separate presentation on this alone)
- Recommendations to the user/customer ("Did you know that you can do X like this?")
- Statistics on frequency and type of use (device, resolution, periphery, duration, ...)
- Targeted surveys to selected user groups beyond customer boundaries
- Collect direct user feedback
- Conversion rate per screen
- (Recordings)/Userflow/Heatmaps

## Or management
- Whether sale of licences or subscriptions
- Tracking and warnings for contingents of users, scans, CPU usage, number of documents, average memory per document, storage space, ...) -> no usage beyond usage rights
- Transparency for EASY and partners


## Support
- Which version is used? 
- Direct more customer information
- History
- Error logging
- Status of the software
- Health status of the system (active notification to the customer)
- Indicators for problems (e.g. performance, critical error messages)
- Possibility to trigger alerts, e.g.,. For monitoring systems
## sales
- Utilisation of servers, software, storage space -> better information for sales, transparency internally and externally, crosselling/upselling, invitation to surveys/feedback discussions, invitation to information/training/events etc. 
- Estimates of future (estimated) consumption
- Utilisation display for the customer in the form of a dashboard
- Possibility to sell "smart allotments
- Possibility to make dynamic contract changes (add X if Y)
- Better forecasts for the future solvers, we are engineers with an artistic but much more psychological approach.
