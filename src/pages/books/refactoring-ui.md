title: Refactoring UI
date: 2019-12-12
desc: Refactoring UI is certainly one of the best books on web and mobile UI/UX I've ever read. Along with Krug's Don't Make Me Think, it should be in the library of anyone involved in UI design. Great details and with great practical examples and comparisons.

Interesting look at the world of drugs, comparing in parts what happens in 'normal businesses' like Walmart (how drug cartels copy their way of managing the supply chain), McDonalds (franchising model applied in Mexican gangs) and Disney (why diversification is also important for the underworld). And why the war on drugs can be waged much more effectively by reducing demand rather than supply. Fun to read.
