title: Refactoring UI
date: 2019-12-12
desc: Refactoring UI is certainly one of the best books on web and mobile UI/UX I've ever read. Along with Krug's Don't Make Me Think, it should be in the library of anyone involved in UI design. Great details and with great practical examples and comparisons.
