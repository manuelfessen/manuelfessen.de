"Steal Like an Artist" by Austin Kleon is a book that I discovered and bought at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, and it's been a source of inspiration for me ever since. I pick it up again and again to browse through it. 

The book is a quick and easy read, but it's filled with practical advice and tips for creative people who want to improve their skills. The writing style is entertaining, making the book fun and engaging to read.
The book encourages readers to explore and draw inspiration from the world around them, as well as to embrace the idea that nothing is truly original. It's a great reminder that creativity is a process that involves building upon existing ideas and concepts. It additional provides practical exercises and prompts that encourage us readers to start creating and experiment with new ideas.
