title: Das Caf√© am Rande der Welt
author: John Strelecky

description: Why are you here? This is the most central question (for me) that this book asks the reader. An important question that each individual decides for himself or herself when and if he or she will ever ask this question in life. For my part, the book, which was a Christmas present, actually made me think a bit. I read it regularly again and again and look, discover something new every time.

Why are you here? This is the most central question (for me) that this book asks the reader.
