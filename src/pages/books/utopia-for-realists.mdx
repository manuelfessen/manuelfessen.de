"Utopia for Realists" by Rutger Bregman is a book that I often give as a gift to friends and family for different occasions. The book challenges readers to rethink their views on social and economic policies and suggests alternative solutions that can create a better future for all.

The ideas are well-researched and backed by evidence, and he makes a compelling argument for policies like a universal basic income and shorter workweeks. The book is thought-provoking and inspiring, and it encourages readers to consider the impact of social and economic policies on the user experience of our products and services.
