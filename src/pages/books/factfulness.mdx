"Factfulness" by Hans Rosling is a refreshing read that will challenge your assumptions about the world. Rosling's engaging storytelling style, combined with real-world data and examples, paints a vivid picture of how the world has changed and where it's heading. 
The book is filled with practical advice for critical thinking and separating fact from fiction, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to better understand the world around them. I look forward to re-read the book in a year or two to check if my opinion remains the same.
