In recent years, there has been a growing trend of applications, particularly in the mobile space, that seem to look very similar. This homogenization of design has led many people to wonder why so many apps are starting to look the same.

One reason for this is that UX design, like any other field, has its own set of best practices and guidelines. When designers follow these guidelines, their designs are more likely to be effective and easy to use. As a result, many designers end up creating designs that are similar to one another, because they are following the same set of best practices.

Another reason for the homogenization of design is that certain design elements have become more popular over time. For example, the use of flat design, which involves the use of simple, two-dimensional elements, has become more omnipresent in recent years. Each stakeholder uses several products in flat design, which leads to the fact that they like it more (people like what they know) and want to have it in their products, pushing this trend. This has led to a situation where many apps now have a similar visual aesthetic, because they are all using the same design elements.

Furthermore, the increasing dominance of a few major tech companies in the app market has also contributed to the homogenization of app design. These companies, such as Google and Apple, have their own design guidelines and standards that developers must follow in order to have their apps approved for their app stores. As a result, many apps on these app stores have a similar look and feel, because they are all following the same design guidelines. It is much easier and more cost effective to build on the work of others than to build everything yourself from scratch. Especially if the user likes and knows this design anyway. 

Another factor contributing to the homogenization of app design is the influence of design agencies and consultants. Many companies, especially smaller ones, rely on these agencies and consultants to help them create their app designs. Because these agencies and consultants often have a set of tried-and-true design techniques and strategies that they use for their clients, this can lead to a situation where many apps end up looking similar to one another.

Additionally, the pressure to create app designs that are intuitive and easy to use has also led to the homogenization of app design. As users have become more accustomed to certain design patterns and conventions, designers have been forced to incorporate these elements into their designs in order to create apps that are easy for users to understand and navigate. This has led to a situation where many app designs are starting to look similar to one another, as designers strive to create user-friendly designs that meet the expectations of their users.

Finally, the growing importance of branding and consistency has also contributed to the homogenization of app design. As companies seek to create a consistent brand experience across all of their products and platforms, they are increasingly standardizing their app designs in order to maintain consistency and coherence. This has led to a situation where many app designs are starting to look similar, as designers strive to create designs that align with their company's brand and visual identity. Especially if the software is to be branded for the customer. 

It's worth noting that the homogenization of app design isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, adhering to established design guidelines and patterns can lead to more efficient and accessible user interfaces. As an example, the design of this website you're currently reading is heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.brianlovin.com">brianlovin.com</a>. 

Overall, the homogenization of design in the world of apps is a result of a combination of factors, including the popularity of certain design elements, cost efficienty and the availability of design tools and frameworks. While it may be disappointing to see so many apps that look the same, it's important to remember that this trend is driven by a desire to create effective and user-friendly designs. And in the end, users would rather have a familiar, efficient user interface than something artsy. And that's what matters, the best for the user.
