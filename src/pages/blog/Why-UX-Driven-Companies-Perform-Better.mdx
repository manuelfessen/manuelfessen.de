User experience (UX) plays a crucial role in the success of a company. 
UX-driven companies prioritize the needs and satisfaction of their users, resulting in a better overall experience for the customer. This, in turn, leads to improved customer loyalty and increased profitability. 
Lets take a look at Germany, there are many examples of UX-driven companies that have achieved great success.

One such example is Zalando, an online fashion retailer that has grown to become one of the largest e-commerce companies in Europe. They became popular by their annoying advertisement (link)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI2y4GikP20] and kept their customer by a strong emphasis on UX, continuously gathering user feedback and using it to improve the shopping experience on its website and mobile app. As a result, the company has been able to establish a strong customer base and achieve impressive growth.

Another example is N26, a digital bank that has quickly gained popularity among customers in Germany and beyond. N26 prioritizes UX in its product design, making its banking app intuitive and easy to use. This has helped the company attract a large number of users and differentiate itself from traditional banks.

Additionally, the Munich-based insurance company Friendsurance is a great example of a UX-driven company. Friendsurance has developed a unique business model that allows customers to form groups and share their insurance premiums. The company's website and mobile app are user-friendly and make it easy for customers to understand and manage their insurance policies. This has helped Friendsurance achieve significant growth and expand into new markets.

UX-driven companies perform better than their non-UX-driven counterparts because they prioritize the user's perspective and needs. The listed companies have all demonstrated the success that can come from putting UX at the forefront of their business strategies.
