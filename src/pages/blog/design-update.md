### Introduction
Today I want to share my knowledge and experiences on how to create a new design system next to your daily work. This blog is especially helpful when you do not have the time to sit down, do a workshop and concentrate 100 percent on the task itself. 
I structure this in an autobiographic way. I describe the process we went through and always complement it directly with the **learnings** we were able to draw from it. You can skip our mistakes and use our best practices. Alternatively, you can jump directly to the [TLDR](#tldr) to see the learnings in a list, but then you miss the backstory.

### Backstory
It finally happened. We succeeded in winning the stakeholders to the idea of a new design system. Finally. Only we had to do it alongside our regular work. We went way too long with the old design framework, it was not just the fact we were bored by the design. It was out of time, we jumped on the wrong design trend and now we were in this situation. I held on to the system for far too long and defended it until shortly before. All the more so because I was significantly involved in the previous system. It was especially hard because it was the first big task after university and I was very motivated to deliver. Question your own ideas and your work with a certain distance in time. Especially if you are very attached to them.**Take the time to ask yourself about your own work: what would I do differently today and why?**

So I had the idea: **A design challenge**. We knew from our experience and research before this redesign that a handful of difficult screens would be a good indicator for our product pages. The screens covered all the important (and difficult) subjects and marked the edge points of our software for the next years. **Take the hard away and communicate this openly in the team and to stakeholders.** This is really important, in real life, no one benefits from beautiful dribbble or Behance screens unless they represent the real world. **Design follows function**.
I collected the functional and non-functional requirements with the stakeholders and collected some exemplary screens from the product. **Involving the stakeholders is significant, as their knowledge about the company's long-term goals and their experiences are immensely important**. They also give a 'non-designer' perspective. In addition, not involving them could be seen as excluding them, and they could put obstacles in the way afterwards.

### Design challenge
After this work was done we finally started the design challenge. In this challenge we **built a (self-proclaimed) Chinese wall**. What makes me smile till today: I stole this idea from the Television show Suits. The idea was not to show, review, or even talk about our designs, ideas, or wireframes in the next two weeks with the other designers. This was a very fun and educational time phase in our work. Everyone wanted to create the best design but also wanted to know the direction of the other designers. After these two weeks we had an **internal meeting. Everyone had the opportunity to present and explain their work.** We could train our skills in presenting designs. Additional we shared our thoughts and challenges with the others while being in a protected atmosphere. In retrospect, we remember this as valuable. 

### Presentation
In the next step we shared the results with the mentioned stakeholders. They were happy with the results and we have even been able to convince the technical product owners with our work. They enabled us to focus on the next steps and to leave the regular work on the table.

### Merging the best ideas
We reviewed all the designs and tried to **merge the best ideas.** As a solution to this challenge, we tested the different designs with users and some of the stakeholders. After the testing we improved the most successful design with the ideas of the other designers.
However, we did not stop there, once we had this foundation. **We iteratively improved the design system based on user feedback over the past months and years.**

Below are my submissions from autumn 2020. We selected this design because it received the best feedback and promised the most potential. You can see the result of our further development on the [company website](https://www.easy-software.com) (Aug. 2022).

### TLDR
<TLDR>
- Take the time to ask yourself about your own work: what would I do differently today and why?
- Do a design challenge. This little competition compared with the opportunity to think outside of your design system unlocks lots of creativity.
- Involve the Stakeholder upfront, but have something to convince them
- Design follows function, no one needs more useless Dribbble or Behance eye pleaser
- Take the hard away and communicate this openly in the team and to stakeholders.
- Build a Chinese wall: No discussions or feedback among each other, so that everyone can develop freely.
- Do an internal meeting first.
- Do not try to squeeze all the ideas into one design, it is a waste of time. Find the best one and add the other good ideas.
- It is obvious, but I will list it here anyway: Involve the user.  
- Update the system during use, you can't plan all the scenarios in advance.
</TLDR>
