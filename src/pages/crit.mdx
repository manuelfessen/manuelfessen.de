### FAQ

#### Who are you? 
Hey there! I'm Manuel, a UX designer at EASY Software. I'm passionate about creating intuitive and engaging user experiences for digital products. You can learn more about me on my blog. Thanks for stopping by!

#### What is a product design health report?
A product design health report is a thorough evaluation of your product's user experience, user interface, visual, and interaction design, as well as a redesign of one view in your app. It is useful when your product is about to be shipped and needs a final check, when your product has grown inconsistent or outdated, or when your designs do not seem to translate well into production code.

#### What is included in the health report?
The health report includes a user experience, user interface, visual, and interaction design audit, as well as a redesign of one view in your app/website. It does not include a full accessibility audit or a redesign of your entire product. It also does not include changes to your logo, brand, or other thematic elements.

#### What do you need from me?
I will need a list of 1-3 views, pages, or flows that need the most attention. You can also provide a test account with pre-populated data for me to work with. I will also need to know which page to redesign. It would be helpful if you could provide your brand assets, icon set, or other relevant documentation.

#### Are you redesigning my whole product?
I will not be redesigning your entire product. It takes a significant amount of time and effort for a designer to become familiar with a new business, industry, and problem space. For that kind of long-term commitment, it would be better to hire a contractor or full-time designer. I will be evaluating the usability, interactions, interfaces, and workflows of your app, without needing to spend a lot of time learning about the nuances of your product.

- I will not be making any major changes to the features of your app, such as adding or removing features or making changes that would be impossible to implement. I may suggest ways to improve the flow of your app or suggest different solutions to problems, but I will not pretend to have a complete understanding of your business or customers.
- I will not be redesigning your logo, brand, or making other costly thematic changes like color schemes or typefaces. I may recommend small changes in these areas, but ultimately your brand is your own.
- This health report does not include a full accessibility audit. I will point out any accessibility concerns that I encounter, but this report should not be used as a substitute for a professional accessibility audit.
- I am unable to redesign your entire icon system. If you are interested in having your icons redesigned, I can connect you with some of the best icon designers in the industry to do this work.
- I will not be implementing any changes to your code. Please refer to an example health report to get a better idea of what you can expect to receive.
