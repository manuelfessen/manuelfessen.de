# About Me
Here‚Äôs a quick summary of who I am.

I‚Äôm currently working at <a class="underline decoration-blue-400 hover:text-blue-400" href="https://www.easy-software.com" target="_blank">EASY Software</a>. I help with my skills and experience in delivering great User Experience by representing the user and fix problems before they become problems. In order to do this successfully I am planning and conducting user research and competitor analysis, interpreting and processing quantitative and qualitative feedback, determining information architecture and creating site maps, creating prototypes, wireframes and mockups and conducting, planning and interpreting usability tests.<br>

I believe that intuitive and easy to use software is a MUST. Everyone has the right to good software and should have fun while using it. 

I like to educate myself, solve problems and dive into new areas. Lately I've been brushing up on my slightly rusty <a class="" href="https://github.com/manuelfessen" target="_blank">development skills</a>, discovering photography for myself, and getting lost in <a class="underline" href="/books">reading</a> fiction and non-fiction books again. 
You can also find me jogging regularly regardless of the weather or spending time with family and friends. 

## Education
I graduated at [Hochschule Ruhr West](https://www.hochschule-ruhr-west.de/studium/studienangebot/bachelor/mensch-technik-interaktion/) with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering.
