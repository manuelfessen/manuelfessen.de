Intuitive software is a MUST. I believe that everyone has the right to good software and should have fun while using it. In my free time, I like to read, wish to take more photos with my Fujifilm X-T30 and I try to go jogging regularly regardless of the weather.

### Activities
I ~~occasionally~~ share my thoughts about a [book](../books) and ~~maybe~~ soon I will connect my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149011152-manuel-fessen), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/manuel.fessen) and [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31601783) activities more elegantly. Until then I solve it manually.
