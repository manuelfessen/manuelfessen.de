As a UX Designer at <a class="" href="https://www.easy-software.com" target="_blank">EASY Software</a>, I strive to deliver top-notch user experiences by representing the user and identifying and addressing potential issues before they become problems. My skills in planning and conducting user research and competitor analysis, interpreting and processing quantitative and qualitative feedback, determining information architecture and creating site maps, creating prototypes, wireframes and mockups allow me to provide a full human-centered design process. 

I believe that everyone should have access to high-quality software that is enjoyable to use. As a result, I strive to stay up-to-date with industry trends and continuously educate myself on new techniques and technologies.

I have a passion for discovering new information, tackling challenges, and investigating various topics. Recently, I have been working on improving my development abilities, which had become a bit outdated. Using <a target='_blank' class="" href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, a web framework for creating quick, content-focused websites, I created this website on my own. 

Away from the desk I enjoy discovering photography, <a class="" href="/books">reading</a> both fictional and nonfictional books, going for jogs regardless of the weather, spending time with my loved ones, and playing Pokemon Go.

## Education
I hold a B.Sc. in Human Computer Interaction from [Hochschule Ruhr West](https://www.hochschule-ruhr-west.de/studium/studienangebot/bachelor/mensch-technik-interaktion/) and I am [certified](https://www.certible.com/de/verify/?id=66aa8aea3d6c93d6be72fb65630a164c) to conduct preparatory courses for the CPUX-F exam. I also successfully prepared the UX team at EASY Software for the CPUX-F certification.
