# About Me

I‚Äôm currently working at <a class="underline decoration-blue-400 hover:text-blue-400" href="https://www.easy-software.com" target="_blank">EASY Software</a>. I help with my skills and experience in delivering great User Experience by representing the user and fix problems before they become problems. In order to do this successfully I am planning and conducting user research and competitor analysis, interpreting and processing quantitative and qualitative feedback, determining information architecture and creating site maps, creating prototypes, wireframes and mockups.
**I deliver the complete human-centred design process.** <br />

I believe that intuitive and easy to use software is a MUST. Everyone has the right to good software and should have fun while using it. 

I like to educate myself, solve problems and dive into new areas. Lately I've been brushing up on my slightly rusty <a class="" href="https://github.com/manuelfessen" target="_blank">development skills</a>, discovering photography for myself, and getting lost in <a class="underline" href="/books">reading</a> fiction and non-fiction books again. 
You can also find me jogging regularly regardless of the weather or spending time with family and friends. 

## Education
I graduated at [Hochschule Ruhr West](https://www.hochschule-ruhr-west.de/studium/studienangebot/bachelor/mensch-technik-interaktion/) with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering. 

I successfully prepared the UX team internally for the [CPUX-F certificate](https://www.certible.com/de/verify/?id=66aa8aea3d6c93d6be72fb65630a164c), after the exam I am officially allowed to conduct preparatory courses for the CPUX-F exam due to the achieved score.
