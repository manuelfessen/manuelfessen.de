## UX Designer
#### easy software AG (2019 - Present)
Since 2019, I've been with easy software AG, where I quickly moved up to lead a team of designers. My job shifted towards focusing more on the bigger picture of UX architecture, strategic planning, handling relationships with our stakeholders, and talking directly with clients and users.

## Student assistant
#### easy software AG (2016 - 2018)
My primary focus was on user research and testing. By identifying addressing and solving usability issues, enhanced the practicality and user-friendliness of easy's digital document management products. Particularly enjoyable: the establishment of a testing laboratory for usability enhancements and the research of Mixed Reality applications.
## Community Manager
#### Ludetis UG (2013 - 2019)
Ludetis UG is a gaming company specializing in mobile games like 'Kick It Out!', a football manager game known for its innovative approach for its time. In my role as Community Manager, I gained invaluable insights into the importance of user feedback. This experience went beyond theoretical learning; as a community manager, I directly felt the impact of new designs through immediate user feedback. This hands-on experience was crucial in understanding the real-world effects of UX decisions and underscored the importance of closely listening to the user community. These efforts leading to the implementation of the still used <a target='_blank' href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ludetis.android.kickitout&hl=de&gl=US">design</a>. 

## Education
My educational background is in Human-Computer Interaction, which underpins my professional skills in UX research, design thinking, and prototyping. I am [certified](https://www.certible.com/de/verify/?id=66aa8aea3d6c93d6be72fb65630a164c) to conduct preparatory courses for the CPUX-F exam. I also successfully prepared the UX team at easy software for the CPUX-F certification.
