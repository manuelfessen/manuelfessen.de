## UX Designer / Teamlead
#### easy software AG (2019 - Present)
Since 2019, I've been with easy software AG, where I quickly moved up to lead a team of designers. My job shifted towards focusing more on the bigger picture of UX architecture, strategic planning, handling relationships with our stakeholders, and talking directly with clients and users.

I'm also really proud of the CPUX-F workshop I put together for our team. It was a great experience, not just for the learning but for bringing our diverse group together and strengthening our skills as a unit.

## Student assistant
#### easy software AG (2016 - 2018)
My primary focus was on user research and testing. By identifying addressing and solving usability issues, enhanced the practicality and user-friendliness of easy's digital document management products. Particularly enjoyable: the establishment of a testing laboratory for usability enhancements and the research of Mixed Reality applications.
## Community Manager
#### Ludetis UG (2013 - 2019)
Ludetis UG is a gaming company specializing in mobile games like 'Kick It Out!', a football manager game known for its innovative approach for its time. In my role as Community Manager, I gained invaluable insights into the importance of user feedback. This experience went beyond theoretical learning; as a community manager, I directly felt the impact of new designs through immediate user feedback. This hands-on experience was crucial in understanding the real-world effects of UX decisions and underscored the importance of closely listening to the user community. These efforts leading to the implementation of the still used <a target='_blank' href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ludetis.android.kickitout&hl=de&gl=US">design</a>. 

## Education
My educational background is in Human-Computer Interaction, which underpins my professional skills in UX research, design thinking, and prototyping. I am [certified](https://www.certible.com/de/verify/?id=66aa8aea3d6c93d6be72fb65630a164c) to conduct preparatory courses for the CPUX-F exam. I also successfully prepared the UX team at easy software for the CPUX-F certification.
