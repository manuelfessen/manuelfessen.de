1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
By downloading, installing, or using the SpeedTracker application ("App"), you expressly agree to these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the App.

2. LICENSE GRANT
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely for personal, non-commercial purposes associated with your Apple ID or iCloud account.

Apple's Required Terms:
- These Terms and Conditions are between you and the App developer, not with Apple Inc.
- Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
- Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App or your possession/use of the App.
- Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge of any third-party intellectual property infringement claims.
- Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and are entitled to enforce them against you.

3. USER RESPONSIBILITIES

Users are solely responsible for the lawful and safe use of the App. Compliance with all local traffic laws, speed limits, and safe driving practices is mandatory. **The driver of a vehicle is strictly prohibited from operating or interacting with the App while the vehicle is in motion. Only passengers or individuals outside of a moving vehicle may use the App.**

We explicitly do not guarantee the legal, factual accuracy, or reliability of the App's speed measurements, distance calculations, or other metrics. The App is provided as a statistical tool for informational purposes only.

Users explicitly agree not to:

- Modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App.
- Use the App for any illegal, unethical, or unauthorized purpose, including but not limited to speeding or participating in races.
- Share login credentials or access with third parties.
- Create derivative works based on the App.
- Attempt to circumvent subscription restrictions or payment systems.
- Export, re-export, or use the App in violation of applicable export control laws.
- **As the driver of a vehicle, interact with or operate the App while the vehicle is in motion.** Use the App while operating a vehicle in an unsafe manner, in violation of local traffic laws, or in any way that distracts from safe driving.
- Rely on the App as a replacement for official speedometers, legally required safety equipment, or navigation systems. The vehicle's official speedometer is the only legally recognized indicator of speed.
- Use the App for tracking individuals without their express consent.
- Use the App to enable, encourage, or facilitate reckless driving, street racing, speeding, or any other dangerous or illegal activities. The App is a tool for recording statistics, not for promoting unlawful behavior.

4. APP MONETIZATION AND FUTURE PREMIUM FEATURES

The App is currently provided completely free of charge. However, we explicitly reserve the right to:
- Introduce premium (paid) features in the future
- Convert currently free features to premium (paid) features
- Implement subscription models or one-time purchase options
- Make any changes to the App's monetization model

These changes may be implemented at any time without prior notice. By continuing to use the App after such changes, you consent to the new terms.

If and when premium features are introduced, payments will be processed by Apple's App Store, not the App developer, and will be subject to Apple's App Store terms and conditions.

ADVERTISING NOTICE

Currently, the App does not contain any advertising. However, we explicitly reserve the right to introduce advertisements into the App in the future. Should we introduce advertising, we may also offer paid options to remove advertisements.

By continuing to use the App after the introduction of advertising, you consent to receiving advertisements as part of the service.

5. LOCATION DATA AND TRACKING DISCLAIMER

The App utilizes device location services, GPS data, and motion sensors to track speed, distance, routes, and other movement data. This information is provided exclusively for informational and statistical purposes. It is not intended for navigation or as a substitute for safe driving practices or legally required vehicle instrumentation. **Usage by the driver while the vehicle is in motion is strictly prohibited.**

We explicitly disclaim liability for:

- Any inaccuracies, errors, omissions, or misleading information in speed or distance measurements.
- Decisions or actions taken by users based on App-generated data.
- Consequences arising from reliance on the App's speed, distance, or location metrics.
- Any civil or criminal liability arising from speeding or traffic violations based on App data.
- Service outages, inaccuracies due to GPS signal loss, or device hardware limitations.
- **Any damages or liability arising from the driver's use of the App while the vehicle is in motion.**

The App's measurements and calculations do not constitute legally verified measurements for purposes of contesting speeding tickets or other violations. Users must rely on their vehicle's speedometer as the primary speed indicator while driving.

We strongly caution against **any** use of the App by the driver while actively driving a vehicle. If the App must be used while the vehicle is in motion, it must be operated **only by a passenger**. Recommendations for passenger use include:
- Using a secure vehicle mount if applicable
- Setting up the App before beginning the journey
- Minimizing interaction with the App while in motion
- Following all applicable laws regarding device usage in vehicles
- Never allowing the driver to be distracted by the App's operation

Specific examples of potential measurement inaccuracies include, but are not limited to:
- Speed readings that differ from the vehicle's built-in speedometer
- Distance calculations that vary from actual traveled distances
- Location accuracy issues in areas with poor GPS reception (tunnels, urban canyons, dense forests)
- Elevation measurement discrepancies
- Temporary data inconsistencies during signal loss or device performance limitations

Users bear sole and complete responsibility for adhering to all traffic laws, speed limits, and safe driving practices regardless of information displayed by the App. The App is intended as a supplementary statistical tool only and must never supersede official speed limits, traffic signs, safe driving judgment, or legal requirements. Misuse of the App, including using it to justify or facilitate speeding, illegal activities, or **use by the driver while driving**, is strictly prohibited and is the sole liability of the user.

We explicitly reserve the right to modify the scope of free and premium features, convert free functions to premium, or introduce new premium features at any time. Such changes do not constitute a defect, provided the core purpose of the App is maintained and users are notified at least 30 days in advance.

Users with active subscriptions retain access to subscribed features until the end of their subscription period. Changes apply only to future subscriptions or renewals.

All payments made for premium services or in-app purchases are final and non-refundable unless otherwise required by applicable law. Any refund requests must be submitted to Apple through the App Store.

Essential contractual obligations particularly include providing the App's basic functionality and maintaining minimum standards of data security as described herein.

We explicitly disclaim any liability for traffic violations, fines, accidents, damages, or any other incidents that may occur during the use or misuse of the App, **particularly if the App was being operated by the driver while the vehicle was in motion**.
